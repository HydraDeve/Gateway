# BEFORE INSTALL

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed in your system. You can check your node version using
    "node -v" and node package manager using npm -v. Node version must be 14.0 or higher!
    We recommend using the current LTS version! You can check what is current LTS from:
    https://nodejs.org/en/

    When you have Nodejs in your system you should update NPM(node package manager) to latest.
    => npm install -g npm@latest

    If you dont have Node.js installed, you should check out these tutorials. (debian guide works on almost any linux distro)
